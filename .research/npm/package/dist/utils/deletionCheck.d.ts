/**
 * The verdict ADT returns from `POST /sap/bc/adt/deletion/check`.
 *
 * Twenty-seven modules called that endpoint and threw the answer away, then
 * sent the DELETE regardless. The result was the worst of the three possible
 * behaviours: the object survived, the call reported `errors: []`, and the
 * caller was told the deletion had happened. Chasing an append structure that
 * "would not delete" cost most of a session before the cause turned out to be
 * a verdict nobody read.
 *
 * The response carries more than a yes/no — it says how many references stand
 * in the way, which is what a caller needs to act on:
 *
 * ```xml
 * <del:object del:isDeletable="true"
 *   del:externalStrongReferences="0" del:externalWeakReferences="0"
 *   adtcore:name="ZAC_SVRD_PROBE" adtcore:type="SRVD/SRV"/>
 *   <del:message del:priority="0" del:type="S"><del:text/></del:message>
 * ```
