/**
 * XML patch utilities for the read-modify-write update pattern.
 *
 * Instead of building XML from scratch (which loses unknown fields like
 * abapLanguageVersion), these helpers modify specific values in the original
 * XML string obtained from GET.
 *
 * **Every patch here fails loudly when it cannot find its target.** That is the
 * point of this module's error handling, and it was learned from a live
 * failure: a full test run reported
 *
 * ```
 * update FAILED (HTTP 400): The description is missing for ZAC_DOM01
 * ```
 *
 * on a domain whose description was present in the configuration all along. The
 * chain was:
 *
 * 1. the GET came back slow, or the object was not yet ready — ADT answers such
 *    reads with **200 and an empty body**, never a 404, so nothing upstream had
 *    a status to react to;
 * 2. `patchXmlAttribute` was asked to set `adtcore:description` and found no
 *    attribute to replace. Being `String.replace`, it returned the input
 *    unchanged — silently;
 * 3. the PUT went out without a description, and the server rejected it.
 *
 * The ABAP system's varying response time is the trigger, and nothing here can
 * change that. What these helpers control is what a slow read turns into: a
 * read error naming the object, or a malformed write blamed on the server. It
 * used to be the second.
